# ðŸ“„ Features Description â€“ Air Quality and Health Impact Prediction Project

This document provides a detailed explanation of the features (variables) used in the air quality and health impact prediction project. Each feature contributes to understanding the environmental and health-related aspects of air pollution.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 1. AQI (Air Quality Index)
- **Description:** A composite index representing overall air pollution levels.
- **Significance:** Higher AQI values indicate unhealthy air conditions for sensitive groups or the general population.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 2. PM10 (Particulate Matter â‰¤10Âµm) [Âµg/mÂ³]
- **Description:** Inhalable particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less.
- **Significance:** Can cause respiratory issues and aggravate cardiovascular and lung diseases.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 3. PM2.5 (Particulate Matter â‰¤2.5Âµm) [Âµg/mÂ³]
- **Description:** Fine particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream.
- **Significance:** One of the most harmful pollutants for human health, especially in urban areas.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 4. NOâ‚‚ (Nitrogen Dioxide) [ppb]
- **Description:** A toxic gas produced by vehicle emissions and industrial activities.
- **Significance:** Can inflame airways and worsen asthma, particularly in children and the elderly.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 5. SOâ‚‚ (Sulfur Dioxide) [ppb]
- **Description:** A gas released from burning fossil fuels, especially coal.
- **Significance:** Causes respiratory irritation and contributes to acid rain formation.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 6. Oâ‚ƒ (Ground-Level Ozone) [ppb]
- **Description:** A pollutant formed by sunlight-driven reactions between NOx and VOCs.
- **Significance:** Impairs lung function and reduces respiratory performance.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 7. Temperature [Â°C]
- **Description:** Recorded ambient temperature.
- **Significance:** Influences the chemical reactions and dispersion of pollutants.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 8. Humidity [%]
- **Description:** Amount of moisture in the air.
- **Significance:** Affects pollutant behavior and concentration levels.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 9. Wind Speed [m/s]
- **Description:** The speed of air movement.
- **Significance:** Helps disperse or accumulate air pollutants in a region.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 10. Respiratory Cases
- **Description:** Number of reported respiratory illness cases in the given time period.
- **Significance:** Indicator of short-term health effects caused by poor air quality.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 11. Cardiovascular Cases
- **Description:** Reported cases of cardiovascular diseases.
- **Significance:** Linked to exposure to pollutants like PM2.5 and NOâ‚‚.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 12. Hospital Admissions
- **Description:** Total hospital visits related to air pollution effects.
- **Significance:** Reflects the burden of pollution on the healthcare system.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 13. Health Impact Score
- **Description:** A combined numerical score based on the severity and frequency of health outcomes.
- **Significance:** Can be used as a regression target variable.

---

## ðŸ”¶ 14. Health Impact Class
- **Description:** Categorization of the health impact score into classes such as Very Low, Low, Moderate, High, and Very High.
- **Significance:** Used as a classification target variable in modeling.

---

## âœ… Notes:
- All features are numeric and preprocessed to handle missing and inconsistent data.
- The dataset supports both **classification** (Health Impact Class) and **regression** (Health Impact Score) tasks.
