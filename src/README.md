# Source Code (src)

This folder contains the source code for the project. Here, you will find files related to data processing, model training, and model evaluation.

## Subfolders and Files

- `data_preprocessing.py`: Code for data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature transformation, and preparing the data for modeling.
- `model_training.py`: Code for training models (such as XGBoost and LightGBM) and tuning hyperparameters.
- `model_evaluation.py`: Code for evaluating models, including calculating accuracy, F1-score, and displaying the confusion matrix.
- `shap_analysis.py`: Code for SHAP analysis to interpret the models and identify important features.
- `utils.py`: A collection of helper functions to assist with data and model tasks.

## How to Use

1. First, download the data from [Kaggle - Air Pollution Health Impact Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/...](https://www.kaggle.com/code/seyedarmanhossaini/predicting-public-health-risk-from-air-pollution)).
2. Next, use the `data_preprocessing.py` file for data preprocessing.
3. After preparing the data, you can train the models using the `model_training.py` file.
4. For model evaluation and results, use the `model_evaluation.py` file.
5. For SHAP analysis and model interpretation, use the `shap_analysis.py` file.
